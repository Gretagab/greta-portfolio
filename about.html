    I'm a <strong>UX designer / web developer</strong> based in Seattle, WA. I have a passion for simple web design and love to create for web and mobile devices.
    I think one of my greatest strenghs about being a designer with an engineer experience is that not only I can handle the UX/UI aspects of a project, but I can also fully understand their technical part.
