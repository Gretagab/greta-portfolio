    <h1>Snoooze for better design</h1>

    <p>
      We all live in a social media society, and it’s become so hard to monitor the time we are consuming online. But 2019 might be different.
      A couple of friends announced that they are gone from Facebook admitting that it has become too addictive. An Instagram celebrity with thousands of followers decided that she would give herself a little time away from screens. A co-worker signed off for a weekend with no disturbing devices at all. I personally decided to stay off social media during meals, friends gathering and in bed.</p>

    <p class="old">
      For many years UX designer primary goal was to bring the user in, to insure he uses the product as long as possible, to make him come back soon or even check-in several times a day. We all learned how to design for addiction, inventing new ways to engage the people, make them dependable.</p>

    <p>
      Today people are becoming to understand that technology is designed to keep them hostage. This sad reality forced some tech companies to come up with new ways to build healthy relationships with their users. </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 2018 Apple introduced new tools built into iOS 12 to help customers understand and take control of the time they spend interacting with their iOS devices.</li>
        <li>Facebook rolled out Snooze feature that allows you to temporarily mute people or pages in your feed without unfollowing or unfriending them.</li>
        <li>Gmail lets people with busy inbox snooze an email till later in the day, next day or week. Snoozing email simply makes it pop back in your inbox when you want it to.</li>
        <li>Instagram helps you to avoid infinite scrolling with “You’re all caught up” message. It appears in your feed after you've gone through all the new posts from the past 2 days.</li>
        <li>More and more apps allow to limit the screen time, rewarding the time you spent offline and keeping you away from distractions (Hold.io, Focus Keeper)Freedom ($10, freedomapp.us) or Self Control (free, selfcontrolapp.com).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      This trend will continue to grow in 2019. People want the technology to fulfill their needs respecting their time.
      It is our responsibility, as designers, to give them freedom from distracting pop-ups, buzzing notifications, infinite scrolling and other time consuming UX hooks.
      Instead of fighting for their time and attention we need to design products which will make their work done in minimum amount of time. </p>
